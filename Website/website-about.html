            <p style="color:#5271ff; font-weight:bold; margin-right:50px">Hi! My name is Grace Darby.</p>
            <p style="margin-right:50px">I am 16 years old, and I live in Connecticut.</p>
            <p style="margin-right:50px">My interests include reading, music, and spending time outdoors. I enjoy tumbling and jugging with my circus troupe, as well as playing trombone in jazz and pit band. I am also a self-taught ukulele and guitar player. I'm interested in studying environmental studies along with web design or communications.</p>
            <p style="margin-right:50px">Right now, you are looking at the first website I've made from scratch. I chose this theme because I wanted my website to be very simple, leaving room for me to potentially add more detail as I learn more about coding. In addition to my limited skills in html, I am also fairly well-versed in website building using programs such as Wix and Weebly. I am looking forward to learning more about web design in the future and building my resume.</p>
